## Project overview

Rust-only EC2 + SSM instance explorer with CLI (`ec2_manager`) and desktop GUI (`ec2_manager_gui`, egui/eframe). The GUI embeds a terminal for interactive SSM sessions.

## Working with this repo

When the user asks to revert, restore, or reference a prior change (e.g. "change it back", "like it was before"), always check recent git history first (`git log`, `git show <sha>`, `git diff <sha>~..<sha>`) to see what was actually changed before making edits. Also check uncommitted/unpushed changes (`git status`, `git diff`, `git diff --cached`) since the relevant change may not yet be committed.

## Build commands

```bash
# Development build (library + CLI)
cargo build

# Development build with GUI
cargo build --features gui

# Run tests
cargo test                  # lib + CLI tests
cargo test --features gui   # all tests including GUI (46 GUI tests)

# Clippy
cargo clippy --features gui

# Full release build (Linux + Windows cross-compile)
./scripts/build_binaries.sh         # or: ./scripts/build_binaries.sh all
./scripts/build_binaries.sh linux   # Linux only
./scripts/build_binaries.sh windows # Windows cross-compile only
```

## Build status

As of 2026-02-13, the full build pipeline passes cleanly:
- `cargo build --features gui` — zero warnings (Linux)
- `cargo test --features gui` — 83 tests pass (34 lib + 3 CLI + 46 GUI)
- `cargo clippy --features gui` — only pre-existing lib-level warnings (derivable_impls on Mode, too_many_arguments on sim::make_instance, collapsible_if in GUI)
- `./scripts/build_binaries.sh` — zero warnings on both Linux (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) and Windows (x86_64-pc-windows-gnu) release targets

## Architecture notes

### Windows embedded terminal

The GUI uses ConPTY (via `portable-pty`) exclusively for embedded terminal sessions. Only PowerShell 7, Windows PowerShell, and Command Prompt are supported as embedded shells on Windows. Git Bash/MSYS2/winpty are **not** used for embedded sessions.

Key functions:
- `filter_embedded_terminals()` in `ec2_manager_gui.rs` — restricts to PowerShell7/WindowsPowerShell/Cmd
- `spawn_pty_session_blocking()` — spawns all sessions via `native_pty_system()` (ConPTY on Windows)
- `pty_command_for_context()` — spawns `aws` directly with SSM args in live mode
- `resize_pty_session()` — propagates resize to both vt100 parser and PTY master

### cfg gates for imports

Test-only imports (`std::process::{Child, Command, Stdio}`) are gated with `#[cfg(test)]` to avoid unused-import warnings on both Linux native and Windows cross-compile targets. Similarly, `shell_plan()` is `#[cfg(test)]` since it's only used in tests.

## Key directories

- `src/` — Rust library and binaries
- `src/bin/ec2_manager_gui.rs` — GUI binary (requires `--features gui`)
- `scripts/` — Build and test helper scripts
- `dist/linux/` and `dist/windows/` — Release artifacts
- `windows-vm/smoke/` — Windows VM smoke test harness

## Smoke tests

```bash
# Shell script assertion tests (run locally without VM)
./scripts/test_run_windows_gui_smoke_test.sh
./scripts/test_windows_gui_smoke_compose.sh
./scripts/test_run_windows_vm_test.sh

# Full Windows VM smoke test (requires Docker + KVM)
./scripts/run_windows_gui_smoke_test.sh
```

The Windows smoke test uses PowerShell (`default_terminal=powershell`) in the guest VM.

## Troubleshooting

### Multi-line paste — only first command runs

Symptom: user pastes N commands from Notepad, all N lines appear echoed in the terminal, but `history` shows only the first (and occasionally 2–3 fast ones); subsequent lines never execute.

Root cause: the drip-feed in `paste_to_connection_tab` previously slept a fixed delay between lines. If the remote shell is still running the previous command when the next `\r` arrives, the TTY line discipline hands the queued bytes to that running command's stdin (where they're discarded) instead of letting bash read them as new commands. Echo happens at the kernel level regardless, so everything looks pasted.

Fix in place (commit on `brandons_changes`): `PtySession.prompt_ready: Arc<(Mutex<u64>, Condvar)>` — a counter that bumps each time the parser sees a fresh shell prompt at the cursor line (bare `$ `/`# ` from the custom PS1, or any `user@host…$/#`). The paste worker snapshots the counter, writes one line, and waits on the condvar (2.5s timeout fallback) before the next line. Prompt-detection lives next to the existing `cursor_is_user_host_prompt` check in the output-processing loop.

If this regresses: verify the PS1 still ends with `$ ` / `# ` (set by `PREP_TERMINAL_COMMAND`), and check the prompt-ready signal site fires by greping debug logs for prompt redraws right after pasted-line output.

### Terminal selection / copy-paste — intermittent

Symptoms (cluster together): highlight appears but right-click copy is empty (next paste returns previous clipboard content), AND double-click word selection silently produces nothing. Keyboard input still works.

Suspect helpers, all in `src/bin/ec2_manager_gui.rs`:
- `pixel_to_grid_cell` — depends on `sel_cell_w/h`, computed from `term_rect` ÷ grid dims. If grid dims are stale, mouse → cell mapping is off and extraction reads wrong row.
- `set_scrollback_for_top_abs_row[_checked]` — vt100 silently clamps if `top_abs_row` exceeds the 2500-line scrollback cap. The `_checked` variant returns `None` on clamp; `extract_selection_text` and the double-click path both use it.
- `find_word_bounds` — returns `(col, col)` on a non-word char, which the double-click handler now logs explicitly.
- `extract_selection_text` — returns `""` on clamp; right-click copy preserves the clipboard on empty extraction (intentional — avoids "right-click ate my clipboard"), which is why a failed copy looks like "paste returned previous content".

Hardening already in place: cell size is computed from `parser.screen().size()` (live grid), not `session.last_size` (which lags during resize).

Diagnostic logs already present — to repro & diagnose, ask the user to capture log lines from the affected tab and look for:
- `primary_pressed tab=… pos=… rect=… cell=…x… live=(RxC) last_size=… cell=(row,col) abs=… scroll_off=…` — TRACE level. Shows whether pointer→cell mapping is sane and whether `live` vs `last_size` disagree.
- `double-click tab=… cell=(row,col) abs_row=… screen_row=… actual_sb=… word=(start..end) row="…"` — DEBUG. The `row=` preview tells you whether the parser returned the row the user actually clicked on.
- `double-click tab=… abs_row=… clamped (past scrollback cap)` — WARN. Selection was past the 2500-line buffer.
- `right-click copy tab=… coords=(abs …) vr=… raw_len=…` — existing DEBUG line; `raw_len=0` means extraction came back empty.
- `extract_selection_text: start.abs_row=… clamped …` — eprintln, shows up on stderr.

When triaging next session, ask the user for the log block around the failed click and walk it top-down: live grid vs last_size → cell mapping → abs_row → screen_row → row preview → word bounds / raw_len.
